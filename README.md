## 📌 Overview

**Med4U** is a full-featured, production-grade healthcare application built with React Native and Expo. It connects patients and doctors through a seamless digital experience — covering appointment booking, real-time video consultations, prescription management, lab test booking, and push notifications.

Designed with clean architecture, offline-first thinking, and real-world scalability in mind.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Healthcare access in India is fragmented — patients struggle to find verified doctors, book reliable appointments, and access their medical records in one place. Existing apps are either too complex or lack real-time communication features.

## 💡 Solution

Med4U provides a unified platform where:
- Patients can discover doctors, book appointments, and consult via video — all in one app
- Doctors can manage availability, conduct consultations, and upload prescriptions
- Admins can verify doctors and manage platform integrity
- The system works offline-first and syncs seamlessly when back online
